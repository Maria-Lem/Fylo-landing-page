## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out the project both a mobile and a desktop version to the designs inside the `/design` folder. Also to get it looking as close to the design as possible, and  make it responsive.

I used HTML & SASS to create this webpage.
